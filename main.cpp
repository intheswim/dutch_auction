//  The problem:
//  You are the owner of a movie theater with 100 seats.
//  You are selling tickets to groups of people who are offering 
//  their a) price per ticket, b) number of seats they want.

//  You can take only the complete offer of a group, you cannot sell
//  them five seats when they are asking for ten.
//
//  All groups will be paying the lowest price among accepted offers.
//  For example, if group one offers to buy 50 tickets for 10 dollars each
//  and group 2 offers to also buy 50 tickets for 8 dollars each and you 
//  fulfill both offers, both groups will be paying 8 dollars per seat.

//  Your goal is to maximize the revenue from the movie.
//  Optimal solution does not always mean the theater will be full.
